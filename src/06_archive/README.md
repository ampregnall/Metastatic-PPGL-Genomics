This folder contains analyses that were performed on our cohort but not included in the final manuscript. They are included for transparency and to maintain a record of these analyses if they are needed in the future.
## Enrichment Analysis
We performed a gene set enrichment analysis based on (1) genes impacted by somatic variants and (2) genes impacted copy number variants using the protocol outlined by [Reimand et al (Nature Protocols 2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-018-0103-9). 
## Mutational Signatures
We performed a mutational signature extraction using the Python packages `SigProfilerMatrixGenerator` and `SigProfilerExtractor`.
## HR Deficiency
We calculated homologous recombination deficiency scores using the R package `HRDex`.
